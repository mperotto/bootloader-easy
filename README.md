# bootloader-easy
The easiest way to create your own bootloader OS

Welcome !


The codingground allows you to compile assembly codes only for linux systems, not offering support for creating bootloader.
The solution created here was to use shellscript to compile the code inside a stream and then upload it to a file storage service.
Also used is the excellent https://copy.sh/v86/ service that allows you to run an operating system in the browser.


To create and test the bootloader, access:

And change the code between line four and EOF as you want, then press execute.

On right side, you can download your boot image:
(Errors and warnings are labeled on this section too)

https://transfer.sh/xxxxx/hello_world_bootloader.img 
 
copy the url above and download image.

Then Start https://copy.sh/v86/ and then select file to
   Floppy disk image,then press 'Start Emulation'
